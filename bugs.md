bugs & UX

- empty forms when submit to prevent rebounce issues
- relocate item needs validation with warning when a new box (This can probably wit for the Zod implementation)
- relocate item : destination and user name are required. the user name is stored in the local storage and auto set.
- open kivi: no visible link. simply a card with a header and an icon. Also add a card 'open shop' in the same manner
- remove header and header nav
- 'Find Items': combine inputs and search buttons for a cleaner look (This will be resolved with tailwind styling)
- 'Find Items': automatically determine if searched value is box or item
- 'Stats': Add printer connectivity (red/green circle), remove health state
- the endpoint to move a box does not exist. missing api endpoint
- moving an item does not work. api seems broken
- the view 'ui/item' should display the box the item is in in the header as well

- home button on top
- recent boxes/activity some padding
- box view needs location to be visible
- different background colors for items and boxes for user guidance. conteiner background and pils with differetn colors
- box view: 'Add item'
