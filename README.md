a small service to map items to the boxes their stored in and the location they're placed.
the workflow is very basic: items are created according to a predefined scheme. items are either placed on a new or existing box. boxes are linked to a location.
when creating a box a label with key values and a qr code is printed to allow for inspection of a boxes content.
