# Open Bugs & Issues

This list tracks defects that require fixes. Cross-reference the planning context in [OVERVIEW.md](/docs/OVERVIEW.md) and the component guidance in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). When fixing a Bug remove it from this list.

## Current bug focus (v2.4)

- Items in the items list in a box should display the shelf as location if the item is in a shelf or the item is in a box which is in a shelf.
  - Reason: current placement context is incomplete for operators during box workflows.
  - Higher-level goal: improve location visibility accuracy without changing item data contracts.

<!-- TODO(bugs-v2.4): keep this list limited to currently actionable bugs only. -->
