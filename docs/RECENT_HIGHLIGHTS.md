# Recent Highlights

- Moved the detailed activities feed to `/activities` while limiting the landing page card to the latest three events with a shortcut link.
- Expanded the localized event label maps to cover newly tracked agentic lifecycle steps so UI timelines render translated copy for every restart, cancelation, and QR scan.
- Corrected the backend media directory resolution to keep item image persistence working after build outputs move into `dist/backend`.
- Enhanced the Node-based test harness with Jest-style utilities, enabling async-friendly matchers and richer diagnostics when running `node scripts/run-tests.js`.
- Added a manual fallback control to the agentic item creation form so users can exit to manual editing while preserving draft data.
- Introduced the shared `LoadingPage` experience on landing and item list routes so top-level pages display a consistent loading state while fetching data.
- Ensured item categories persist and round-trip correctly even without Artikelnummer assignments, with logging to surface missing metadata.
- Item and box label printing now share a single PDF per request, leave previews downloadable, and route jobs through the configured CUPS queue with structured error reporting.
- Added backend support to remove items from boxes and delete items or boxes via new API endpoints.
- Exposed removal and deletion controls in the React UI and made stock counts read-only when editing items.
- Wrapped removal and deletion in database transactions and added unit tests to verify item stock and box deletion logic.
- Extended existing move and save/import actions to use database transactions for atomic updates and event logging.
- Introduced a CSV export endpoint with date filters for item data.
- Added an admin endpoint (`POST /api/agentic/queue`) that bulk-queues agentic runs with `mode` filtering (`all` vs `missing`) and logs each queued item for audit history.
- Box and item IDs now follow the `B-ddMMyy-####` / `I-ddMMyy-####` pattern.
- Added an API and React page to list all items, linked from the search card.
- Confirmed inventory adjustments, styled item lists for mobile, added filter for unplaced items, and disabled UI during CSV uploads with automatic reload.
- CSV validation now reports the number of parsed items and boxes.
- Styled the AddItemToBoxDialog modal using shared card classes for a consistent look.
- Reintroduced Box IDs on overview and box detail cards, aligned CSV export columns with import format, restyled the add-item dialog text color, and switched list views to short `dd.MM.yyyy` dates.
- Persisted up to three item images to `media/{ItemId}` and stored the first image path in `Grafikname`.
- Warn users when deleting a non-empty Behälter and translate UI text from "Box" to "Behälter" throughout.
- Statistics now show "Artikel ohne Behälter" and list pages use `dd.MM.yyyy` dates.
- Item details now show the creator and current stock, remove the Standort field, and events list include article numbers and descriptions.
- Images persist across item edits with `{Artikelnummer}-{imgNumber}` naming, and item models no longer carry picture fields.
- Restored agentic search-query storage using the streamlined `backend/db.ts` schema and the new `upsertAgenticRun` helper.
- Updated the item creation workflow to trigger agentic runs asynchronously via `frontend/src/components/ItemCreate.tsx` while `backend/actions/import-item.ts` handles persistence and image writes.
