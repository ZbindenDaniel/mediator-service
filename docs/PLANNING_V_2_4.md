# Planning v2.4

This document tracks planning inputs for **version 2.4**.

## Current status

No v2.4 implementation work has started yet.

Reason: separate upcoming planning work from shipped v2.3 history to keep release coordination auditable and reduce stale-plan noise in active documentation.

Higher-level goal: keep v2.4 planning minimal, explicit, and easy to execute in small reviewable steps.

## Planning intake template (use when v2.4 work starts)

- Goal: what outcome is needed.
- Reason: why this change is needed now.
- Scope: minimal files/modules to touch.
- Data contracts: confirm whether `models/` or API payloads are affected.
- Logging/error handling expectations: where existing logs/try-catch paths should be extended.

<!-- TODO(planning-v2.4): add first scoped v2.4 plan item when implementation begins. -->
